# fraud-detection-mlops

**End-to-end Machine Learning pipeline for real-time fraud detection in a simulated FinTech environment.**

---

## ðŸ“Œ Overview

This project simulates a production-ready ML pipeline for detecting fraudulent transactions in a financial ecosystem. It integrates modern data architecture patterns like Lambda Architecture, real-time processing with Kafka and Spark, and MLOps practices including CI/CD, containerization, and model deployment using AWS services.

This solution showcases essential skills of a Machine Learning Engineer in the fintech space.

## ðŸš€ Key Features

- Lambda Architecture: batch + streaming + serving layers  
- Apache Spark: big data processing & optimizations  
- Kafka: real-time ingestion and alert streaming  
- Feature Store: offline (Spark+Parquet) + online (Redis)  
- MLOps: model versioning, Docker, GitHub Actions, CI/CD workflows  
- Deployment: FastAPI + AWS Lambda / SageMaker Endpoint  
- Orchestration: Apache Airflow or AWS Glue  
- Monitoring: drift detection, inference logs, basic alerting
